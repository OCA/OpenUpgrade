<h1>Migration Files<a class="headerlink" href="#migration-files" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>For each odoo module, a <strong>migration directory</strong> contains the analysis of
the differences between the previous version and the current version
and the migration scripts developed to ensure the migration
of this module runs properly.</p>
<section id="for-versions-14-0-and-higher">
<h2>For versions 14.0 and higher<a class="headerlink" href="#for-versions-14-0-and-higher" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Migration directories are hosted in <cite>scripts</cite> subdirectory of the
openupgrade_scripts module directory in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade">https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade</a>
repository.</p>
<p>For example, the migration folder for migrating the <cite>account</cite> module
from version 13.0 to version 14.0 is located here :</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade/tree/14.0/openupgrade_scripts/scripts/account/">https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade/tree/14.0/openupgrade_scripts/scripts/account/</a></p>

<section id="for-versions-13-0-and-below">
<h2>For versions 13.0 and below<a class="headerlink" href="#for-versions-13-0-and-below" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Migration directories are hosted in the <cite>migration</cite> folder of each module
in the forks of Odoo at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade">https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the migration folder for migrating the <cite>account</cite> module

</section>
<section id="non-official-addons">
<h2>Non official addons<a class="headerlink" href="#non-official-addons" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For OCA or custom addons, migration directories are hosted in the <cite>migration</cite>
folder of each module.</p>
<p>For example, the migration folder for migrating the OCA <cite>account_global_discount</cite> module

</section>
<section id="directory-contents">
<h2>Directory contents<a class="headerlink" href="#directory-contents" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The contents of the migration directory per module are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A file <cite>openupgrade_analysis.txt</cite> that contains data model changes and
changes in the set of XML records</p></li>
<li><p>A file <cite>openupgrade_analysis_work.txt</cite> which is a copy of the previous file,
annotated by the developers of the migration scripts</p></li>
<li><p>A file <cite>noupdate_changes.xml</cite> containing changes that may need to be loaded
during module migration (after reviewing the contents of this automatically
generated file).</p></li>
<li><p>A file <cite>pre-migration.py</cite> (or any Python file(s) starting with <cite>pre-</cite>) that
is executed by the Odoo migration manager just before the module is loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>A file <cite>post-migration.py</cite> (or any Python file(s) starting with <cite>post-</cite>) that
is executed by the Odoo migration manager right after the module was loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>A file <cite>end-migration.py</cite> (or any Python file(s) starting with <cite>end-</cite>) that
is executed by the Odoo migration manager when all modules have been
processed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The migration directory of the base module contains an additional file
<cite>openupgrade_general_log.txt</cite>. This file contains some statistics as well
as the analysis records of modules that could not be found in the target
release of Odoo anymore.</p>
</section>
<section id="generate-the-difference-analysis-files">
<h2>Generate the difference analysis files<a class="headerlink" href="#generate-the-difference-analysis-files" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can create a custom set of analysis files on any set of modules between
any two versions of Odoo using the <cite>upgrade_analysis</cite> module that is hosted
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/oca/server-tools">https://github.com/oca/server-tools</a>.
(for versions 13.0 or lower, the module is named <cite>openupgrade_records</cite> and is
place in each branch of the OpenUpgrade repository under
<cite>odoo/addons/openupgrade_records</cite> path)</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis-files-description">
<h2>Analysis files description<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-files-description" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first section displays models which are added or removed from the database.</p>
<p>The second section lists the model fields which have been signalled by the
analysis script. Every line lists the following columns:</p>
<p>module / model / field (field type) : description of the change</p>
<p>Multiple changes per field are listed on separate lines.
If possible, the old situation is added to the change description (in between
parentheses).</p>
<p>The change description flags the following types of change:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>The field is now required. The upgrade script might apply the default for
this field, if it is encoded in the model, or any value that you might see
fit (see the openupgrade library
function <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_defaults()</span></code>). If any empty values remain,
these can be reported by the openupgrade report module (TODO).
If the field is a function field after the upgrade, this changes the cause
for action. See below.</p></li>
<li><p>A field is now a function or a related field. This might or might not call
for any action of your upgrade script, as the value is now automatically
determined. At the same time, this might cause data loss. An example is
the field employee’s manager (hr module), which in Odoo 6 is derived
from the employee’s department.</p>
<p>Without any action in the upgrade script, you will lose the manually
encoded employee hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A selection field’s hardcoded selection changes. You need to audit the
function for any change in possible values and may need to map any
differences you encounter.</p></li>
<li><p>A selection field’s selection is now being filled by a function or has
stopped doing so. You need to audit the function for any change in
possible values and may need to map any differences you encounter.</p>
<p>(Of course, a selection function could change the set of possible values
in between functions.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The field changes type. This always calls for action in your upgrade
script. Rename the database column to a temporary name in the pre script,
then migrate the values in the post script. A typical instance of this
change is when the field becomes a many2one lookup table, or the other way
around. An example of these are the partner’s function which became a char
field in Odoo 6, and the partner’s title which as a selection (thus
char type database column) and had to be migrated to a many2one on
res.partner.title.</p></li>
<li><p>A relation field’s relation changes. You need to migrate the one target
model to the other, and update the references to them.</p></li>
<li><p>A field is deleted from the model (marked by ‘DEL’). Also fields from
deleted models are marked in this way. TODO: mark fields from deleted
models in a distinct manner. Any distinct features of the field are
displayed, for easier manual matching.
You need to audit any new fields
(see below) to see if they correspond to the deleted field and implement
this change in your upgrade script. It might also be the case that a
deleted field is now delegated to a new or existing _inherits table (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>A field is introduced in the model (marked by ‘NEW’). Also fields from
introduced models are marked in this way. TODO: mark fields from introduced
models in a distinct manner? Any distinct features of the field are
displayed, for easier manual matching. You need to audit any deleted
fields (see below) to see if they correspond to the new field and
implement this change in your upgrade script.</p></li>
<li><p>The _inherits property of a model has changed. It might be the case that
fields which are removed are actually delegated to this newly
inherited table.</p></li>
<li><p>A new model is introduced. Copy all access data from the access csv and
security rules xml files and load them in your script. Also copy any
other data that may be introduced in this release of Odoo. This may
have consequences for other modules’ migration scripts. TODO: create an
overview of new or renamed modules.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The final section of the database layout analysis contains a simple report on
the changes that were detected.</p>
</section>
<section id="xml-ids">
<h2>XML IDs<a class="headerlink" href="#xml-ids" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The OpenUpgrade analysis files give a representation of the XML IDs that a
module defines, in comparison with the previous release of the module.</p>
<p>XML IDs which do not occur in the updated version of all installed modules
will be removed automatically by the Odoo server, if they do not have
the noupdate attribute. Therefore, you can ignore most entries here, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>ir.actions.*</p></li>
<li><p>ir.model.fields</p></li>
<li><p>ir.model.access</p></li>
<li><p>ir.model</p></li>
<li><p>ir.ui.*</p></li>
<li><p>res.country*</p></li>
<li><p>res.currency*</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When XML ids of such record types change, the record will be recreated under
the new id, and the old record will be unlinked.</p>
<p>To manage changes to data defined with the noupdate flag,
please refer to the following use case <a class="reference internal" href="use_cases/xml_id_renaming.html"><span class="doc">XML-ID Renaming</span></a>.</p>
