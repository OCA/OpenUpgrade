<h1>Fields analysis format<a class="headerlink" href="#fields-analysis-format" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first section displays models which are removed from the database.
The second section displays models which are added to the database.</p>
<p>TODO: display which models moved to another module, instead of in the field
analysis? It should also be clear how to install such modules from the upgrade</p>
<p>The second section lists the model fields which have been signalled by the
analysis script. Every line lists the following columns:</p>
<p>module / model / field (field type) : description of the change</p>
<p>Multiple changes per field are listed on separate lines.
If possible, the old situation is added to the change description (in between
parentheses).</p>
<p>The change description flags the following types of change:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p>The field is now required. The upgrade script might apply the default for
this field, if it is encoded in the model, or any value that you might see
fit (see the openupgrade library
function <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_defaults()</span></code>). If any empty values remain,
these can be reported by the openupgrade report module (TODO).
If the field is a function field after the upgrade, this changes the cause
for action. See below.</p></li>
<li><p>A field is now a function or a related field. This might or might not call
for any action of your upgrade script, as the value is now automatically
determined. At the same time, this might cause data loss. An example is
the field employee’s manager (hr module), which in Odoo 6 is derived
from the employee’s department.</p>
<p>Without any action in the upgrade script, you will lose the manually
encoded employee hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A selection field’s hardcoded selection changes. You need to audit the
function for any change in possible values and may need to map any
differences you encounter.</p></li>
<li><p>A selection field’s selection is now being filled by a function or has
stopped doing so. You need to audit the function for any change in
possible values and may need to map any differences you encounter.</p>
<p>(Of course, a selection function could change the set of posible values
in between functions.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The field changes type. This always calls for action in your upgrade
script. Rename the database column to a temporary name in the pre script,
then migrate the values in the post script. A typical instance of this
change is when the field becomes a many2one lookup table, or the other way
around. An example of these are the partner’s function which became a char
field in Odoo 6, and the partner’s title which as a selection (thus
char type database column) and had to be migrated to a many2one on
res.partner.title.</p></li>
<li><p>A relation field’s relation changes. You need to migrate the one target
model to the other, and update the references to them</p></li>
<li><p>A field is deleted from the model (marked by ‘DEL’). Also fields from
deleted models are marked in this way. TODO: mark fields from deleted
models in a distinct manner. Any distinct features of the field are
displayed, for easier manual matching.
You need to audit any new fields
(see below) to see if they correspond to the deleted field and implement
this change in your upgrade script. It might also be the case that a
deleted field is now delegated to a new or existing _inherits table (see below).</p></li>
<li><p>A field is introduced in the model (marked by ‘NEW’). Also fields from
introduced models are marked in this way. TODO: mark fields from introduced
models in a distinct manner? Any distinct features of the field are
displayed, for easier manual matching. You need to audit any deleted
fields (see below) to see if they correspond to the new field and
implement this change in your upgrade script.</p></li>
<li><p>The _inherits property of a model has changed. It might be the case that
fields which are removed are actually delegated to this newly
inherited table.</p></li>
<li><p>A new model is introduced. Copy all access data from the access csv and
security rules xml files and load them in your script. Also copy any
other data that may be introduced in this release of Odoo. This may
have consequences for other modules’ migration scripts. TODO: create an
overview of new or renamed modules.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The final section of the database layout analysis contains a simple report on
the changes that were detected.</p>
