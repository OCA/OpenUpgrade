#### FIELDS IN MODEL ACCOUNT.ACCOUNT ####
Generic methods applicable for account.account and account.template, do do in post-migration
- Compute tag_ids:
We should provide a generic method that converts parent accounts into tags, and tag leaf accounts with these tags. Then assign these tags to the account being migrated.

 In Odoo 9 this model groups these lines, so that each account.bank.statement points to a 
 single one cashbox_end_id and cashbox_start_id.

#### FIELDS IN MODEL ACCOUNT.JOURNAL ####
In odoo 9 the customer/supplier refunds use the same journal as the invoices. You can define a separate sequence for refunds. 
We assume that in Odoo 9 the default will be for refunds to use the same sequence as invoices.
The old journals will stay for consistency purposes, but should not be used anymore. Seems hard to devise a strategy to remove the refund journals, and re-direction the account moves to sales journals. Probably in the case of the Odoo default provided sales and refund journals we could do so, but if there are new sales and refund journals we could not possibly know how to map them. To be discussed...

#### FIELDS IN MODEL ACCOUNT.PAYMENT ####
This a new model in Odoo 9. We do not need to migrate anything from 8 to convert it to an account payment. 
In Odoo 8 the payments to customers or suppliers could be done in different ways, such as using vouchers or manual journal entries. 
It is fine to just migrate the journal entries corresponding to payments, not creating account.payment records, 
because Odoo 9 will recognize two AR/AP reconciled entries as a payment in the invoice.
