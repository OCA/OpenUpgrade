This module is a technical module that contains a number of monkeypatches
to improve the behaviour of Odoo when migrating your database using the
OpenUpgrade migration scripts:

* Prevent dropping columns or tables in the database when fields or models
  are obsoleted in the Odoo data model of the target release. After the
  migration, you can review and delete unused database tables and columns
  using `database_cleanup`. See
  https://odoo-community.org/shop/product/database-cleanup-918
* When data records are deleted during the migration (such as views or other
  system records), this is done in a secure mode. If the deletion fails because
  of some unforeseen dependency, the deletion will be cancelled and a message
  is logged, after which the migration continues.
* Prevent a number of log messages that do not apply when using OpenUpgrade.
* Suppress log messages about failed view validation, which are to be expected
  during a migration.
* Run migration scripts for modules that are installed as new dependencies
  of upgraded modules (when there are such scripts for those particular
  modules)

**Table of contents**

Installation
============

This module does not need to be installed on a database.
It simply needs to be available via your ``addons-path``.

Configuration
=============

* call your odoo instance with the option ``--load=base,web,openupgrade_framework``

or

* add the key to your configuration file:

.. code-block:: shell

    [options]
    server_wide_modules = web,openupgrade_framework

When you load the module in either way of these ways, and you have the
`openupgrade_scripts` module in your addons path available, the
`--upgrade-path` option of Odoo will be set automatically to the location
of the OpenUpgrade migration scripts.

Development
===========

The `odoo_patch` folder contains python files in a tree that mimicks the
folder tree of the Odoo project. It contains a number of monkey patches
to improve the migration of an Odoo database between two major versions.

So far, we are able to make everything work without overwriting large blocks
of code, but if larger patches need to be added, please use the method
described below:

To see the patches added, you can use ``meld`` tools:

``meld PATH_TO_ODOO_FOLDER/odoo/ PATH_TO_OPENUPGRADE_FRAMEWORK_MODULE/odoo_patch``


To make more easy the diff analysis :

* Make sure the python files has the same path as the original one.

* Keep the same indentation as the original file. (using ``if True:`` if required)

* Add the following two lines at the beginning of your file, to avoid flake8 / pylint
  errors

.. code-block:: python

    # flake8: noqa
    # pylint: skip-file

* When you want to change the code. add the following tags:

For an addition:

.. code-block:: python

    # <OpenUpgrade:ADD>
    some code...
    # </OpenUpgrade>

For a change:

.. code-block:: python

    # <OpenUpgrade:CHANGE>
    some code...
    # </OpenUpgrade>

For a removal:

.. code-block:: python

    # <OpenUpgrade:REMOVE>
    # Comment the code, instead of removing it.
    # </OpenUpgrade>
