This is an incomplete migration of the account module. You can only use this version safely if you have not used cash boxes.

Two features are now only available for users that are allowed to use them on their user records: creation of pro-forma invoices, and checking the total amount of a supplier invoice.
Invoice rounding before tax application can now be configured globally or per line. Please review this setting in your financial configuration.
If you use point of sale, you will want to configure profit and loss accounts on the relevant journals.

This upgrade resets the contents of your invoice email template, because the old version contains non-existing fields. Because the translations, which contain the same, now invalid references are managed separately, you are encouraged to force an overwrite of the translations and redo any customization of the template.
