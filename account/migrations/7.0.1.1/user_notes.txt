This is an incomplete migration of the account module. You can only use this version safely if you have not used cash boxes.

OpenERP 7.0 in general has a more finegrained control over which users can access which features. The features can be configured through the Access tab on the user record. Two existing features are now governed by these settings: creation of pro-forma invoices, and checking the total amount of a supplier invoice. You need to review these settings if you want them to be available to certain users.

Invoice rounding before tax application can now be configured globally or per line. Please review this setting in your financial configuration.
If you use point of sale, you will want to configure profit and loss accounts on the relevant journals.

This upgrade resets the contents of your invoice email template, because the old version contains non-existing fields. Because the translations, which contain the same, now invalid references are managed separately, you are encouraged to force an overwrite of the translations and redo any customization of the template.

The label of invoice lines is now a multiline text field. Your existing labels and line notes are combined in this new field.
