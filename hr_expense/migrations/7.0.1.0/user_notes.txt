1/ Change in state selection of 'hr_expense_expense.state'

In 6.1 : 
- 'invoiced' state with associated activity 'act_invoice' (kind : sublow 'account.wkf')
- 'paid' state that with associated activity 'act_paid' that is flagged with 'flow_stop'.

In 7.0 : 
- 'done' state with associated activity 'act_done'. (kind : function)
- no 'flow_stop' in wkf_expenses.

Script migration will assume that : 
- 'invoiced' is now 'done' ; 
- 'paid' is obsoleted and changed to 'done' ; 

pre-migration script will do : 
- backup the old state, using a legacy field 'state' ; 
- rename 'act_invoice' to 'act_paid' ; 

post-migration script will do : 
- in 'hr_expense_expense' change 'invoiced' / 'paid' to 'done' ; 
- in wkf_workitem : change items that are in state 'paid', setting act_id to act_done. (before act_paid) ; 
- in wkf_workitem : change items that are in state 'invoiced', setting sublow to None and state to complete (old was running) ; (because there is no more subflow association) ; 
- in wkf_instance : change instances that are complete to active, because there is no more flow_stop activity ;

2/ in 'hr_expense_expense' 'account_move_id' was not filled in V6.1

In 6.1, the account_move_id is present in model but unused ; 
In 7.0, the account_move_id is present, and filled from 'done' state.

Conclusion : it's like a "NEW field".

So there is a bug after migration, by clicking on the button 'Open Accounting Entries' for 'done' expenses. (old 'invoiced' and 'paid').

To fix that, script migration will get the move_id of the account_invoice of the hr_expense for expense in 'paid' state.
The problem persists for old 'invoiced' expense because in this state there is no account_move created.

3/ expense has now a 'voucher_id' field, but this field seems to be unused in 'hr_expense' module.
