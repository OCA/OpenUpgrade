********************************************************************************
1/ If you have defined custom project stages (project.task.type), related state
will be set default to open, and related task will have this state. If you
want to set them to another state, you will have to do it manually.

2/ Project warning messages when you close tasks are lost in the migration,
because they are not easily translated to the new system, so you will have to
rewrite them on v7.

3/ All projects are set by default to public visibility. Change manually
on each project accordingly new possibilities and your needs.
