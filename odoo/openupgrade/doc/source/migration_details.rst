Manual migration
================

Check out the code manually and upgrade your database by calling odoo-bin,
(or openerp-server) directly. You will want to do this when you are working on
developing migration scripts for uncovered modules.

1. Check out the OpenUpgrade source code from Github for the branches you
   need. Each branch migrates to its version from the previous version, so
   branch 7.0 migrates from 6.1 to 7.0. If you are skipping versions, you still
   need to run all the branches in between.

2. Compare your set of installed modules with the modules that are covered by
   the OpenUpgrade Addons branch you are using. Upgrading a database that has
   uncovered modules installed is likely to fail. Authoritative in this respect
   is the existence and contents of a *user_notes.txt* file in the
   migrations/[version] subdirectory of each module. We also try to indicate
   module coverage in the documentation but it sometimes lags behind.

3. Decide which database you are going to upgrade. You absolutely *must* make a
   backup of your live database before you start this process!

4. Edit the configuration files and command line parameters to point to the
   database you are going to upgrade. The parameters will probably be the same
   as you use on your live server, except they point to the OpenUpgrade
   addons source code, point to the database you want to upgrade, and add the
   *--update all --stop-after-init* flags.

5. Run the upgrade and check for errors. You will probably learn a lot about
   your data and have to do some manual clean up before and after the upgrade.
   Expect to repeat the process several times as you encounter errors, clean up
   your data, and try again. If necessary, ask for help or report bugs on
   Github.

6. Once the data migration is successful, run the official version of Odoo
   against it to test how the migrated data behaves under the new version.
   Remember that the OpenUpgrade version of the source code is only intended to
   perform the migration, not run the Odoo server.

General Tips
++++++++++++

* If you migrate your database through multiple versions make sure you use separate directories. If you use one directory and just check out a new branch the remaining *.pyc* files will cause trouble.

* When installing the openupgradelib make sure you check out the latest version from github to get the latest updates and fixes::

    $ pip/pip3 install git+git://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib.git

Configuration options
+++++++++++++++++++++

OpenUpgrade allows for the following configuration options. Add these options
to a separate stanza in the server configuration file under a header
*[openupgrade]*

* *autoinstall* - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names
  as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from
  the value (and their dependencies) are selected for installation as well.

* *force_deps* - A dictionary with module name keys and lists of module names
  as values. If a key module is installed on your database, the modules from
  the value will be treated as a module dependency. With this directive, you
  can manipulate the order in which the modules are migrated. If the modules
  from the value are not already installed on your database, they will be
  selected for installation (as will their dependencies). Be careful not to
  introduce a circular dependency using this directive.
